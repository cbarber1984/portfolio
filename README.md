# Development Portfolio

https://cbarber1984.github.io/portfolio/

##Portfolio site of recent work.

I completed this site as part of the freeCodeCamp responsive web design curriculum.

##Concepts Explored
-HTML
  • Links to external sources for images
  • Using divs to organize content
  • Using id and class attributes to identify elements for later styling
  
-CSS Styling
  • Selecting colors from a design pallette
  • Resizing elements based upon viewport size
  • Planning a layout which involved containers and elements within containers
  
##Next Steps
There are a few things that I would still like to do with this project.

  • Switch the project tile display to a grid when viewing on a large screen
  • Update stock images with screenshots of the actual applications hosted in the assets folder
